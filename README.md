## Sample JS Project Proposal: Pastris

### Background

Pastris is a tile-matching puzzle game, inspired by Tetris. A random number of pieces in shapes of letters ("L", "J", "O", "T", "S", "Z", "I") fall down one by one until they hit the bottom of the field or fall onto another piece. Each piece can be rotated by 90 degrees clockwise. The aim of the game is creating horizontal line of ten blocks (pastris) with no gaps. That's when the line gets destroyed, and all the blocks(pastris) above will fall.


### Functionality & MVP  

With Pastris, users will be able to:

- Start, pause, and reset the game
- Rotate pieces and move them left and right

### Wireframes

This app will consist of a single screen with game field and nav links to the Github and my LinkedIn. Game controls will include Left, Right, Down, Rotate, New Game and Pause buttons as well as Score and Instructions displays.

### Architecture and Technologies

This project will be implemented with `JavaScript` for the game logic using `HTML 5 Canvas` for rendering and `CSS 3` for styling.
